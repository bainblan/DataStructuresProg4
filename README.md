Programming Assignment 4

Baines Blanton and Caleb Cort collaborated on this project

Baines covered all the algorithm implementations except for Quick Sort Iterative, as well as the introduction and conclusion of the typed report
Caleb handled Quick Sort Iterative, the Excel charts, most of the typed report, and the experiment drivers.

How to compile: mvn compile
How to run: 
1. java SortDriver.java file-name
2. Choose a sorting algorithm by typing in one of the letters representing your desired algo.

For example: 
1. java SortDriver.java random.txt
2. m

Most code for the algorithms was taken from the textbook and slides
